capstone project

Project Overview
- Project Name: Predicting Insurance Cost
- Objective: To predict individual medical insurance costs using machine learning algorithms.
- Dataset: The dataset contains 7 features:
    - Age
    - Sex
    - Body Mass Index (BMI)
    - Number of children
    - Smoker (yes/no)
    - Region
    - Charges (target variable)

Tasks
1. Data Preprocessing:
    - Handling missing values
    - Data normalization/scaling
    - Encoding categorical variables
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    - Visualizing distributions of features
    - Identifying correlations between features
    - Understanding the target variable (charges)
3. Feature Engineering:
    - Creating new features from existing ones
    - Transforming features to improve model performance
4. Model Training:
    - Training a linear regression model
    - Training a random forest regressor model
5. Hyperparameter Tuning:
    - Using techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to optimize model hyperparameters
6. Model Evaluation:
    - Evaluating model performance using metrics like mean squared error, mean absolute error, R-squared, etc.

Goals and Deliverables
- Goal: Build an accurate predictive model for insurance costs.
- Deliverables:
    - A well-documented codebase (e.g., Jupyter Notebook)
    - A written report summarizing the project, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation
    - Visualizations and plots to illustrate the findings

Expected Outcomes
- A predictive model that accurately forecasts insurance costs based on individual characteristics.
- Insights into the relationships between features and the target variable.
- Recommendations for future improvements and potential applications of the model.
